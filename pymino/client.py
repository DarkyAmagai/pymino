    """
    `Client` - This is the main client.

    `**Parameters**``
    - `**kwargs` - any other parameters to use for the client.
    - `device_id` - device id to use for the client.
    - `proxy` - proxy string to use for the client.
    - `hash_prefix` - The hash prefix to use for the bot. `Defaults` to `19`.
    - `device_key` - The device key to use for the bot. `Defaults` to `E7309ECC0953C6FA60005B2765F99DBBC965C8E9`.
    - `signature_key` - The signature key to use for the bot. `Defaults` to `DFA5ED192DDA6E88A12FE12130DC6206B1251E44`.
    
    ----------------------------
    Why use `Client` over `Bot`?

    - Used for scripts rather than bots.
    - Lightweight, does not utilize websocket.

    ----------------------------
    Do I have to be logged in to use `Client`?

    - No, you do not have to be logged in to use `Client`.
    - However, you will not be able to use any methods that require authentication.

    `**NON-AUTH EXAMPLE**`
    ```python
    # This method does not require authentication, so it will work without logging in.    

    from pymino import Client

    client = Client()

    print(f"Logged in: {client.is_authenticated}")

    chat_id = client.community.fetch_object_id(link="https://aminoapps.com/p/123456789")

    print(f"Chat ID: {chat_id}")
    ```
    ----------------------------

    How do I login with `Client`?
        - You can login with `Client` by using the `login` method.
        
    `**Login Example**`

    ```python
    from pymino import Client

    client = Client()

    client.login(email="email", password="password")

    print(f"Logged in: {client.is_authenticated}")

    # Output: Logged in: True
    ```
    ----------------------------
    How can I utilize community methods with `Client`?
        - First, you must set the community id.
        - You can set the community id by using the `set_community_id` method
        - Or the `fetch_community_id` method if you do not know the community id.

    `**Community Example**`
    ```python
    from pymino import Client

    client = Client()

    client.login(email="email", password="password")

    print(f"Logged in: {client.is_authenticated}")

    client.fetch_community_id("http://aminoapps.com/c/CommunityName")
    # Or
    client.set_community_id(123456789)

    print(f"Community ID has been set: {client.community_id}")
    ```
    ----------------------------
    `**Community Methods**`
    ```python
    from pymino import Client

    client = Client()

    client.login(email="email", password="password")

    client.fetch_community_id("http://aminoapps.com/c/CommunityName")

    client.community.send_message(
        chatId = "000000-0000-0000-0000-000000",
        content = "Hello, world!"
    ) # This will send in the community you set the community id for.

    #Alternatively, you can use the community id as a parameter.
    comId = client.fetch_community_id("http://aminoapps.com/c/CommunityName")
    client.community.send_message(
        chatId = "000000-0000-0000-0000-000000",
        content = "Hello, world!",
        comId = comId

        `Client` - This is the main client.

        `**Parameters**``
        - `**kwargs` - any other parameters to use for the client.
        - `device_id` - device id to use for the client.
        - `proxy` - proxy string to use for the client.
        - `hash_prefix` - The hash prefix to use for the bot. `Defaults` to `19`.
        - `device_key` - The device key to use for the bot.
        - `signature_key` - The signature key to use for the bot.
        
        ----------------------------
        Why use `Client` over `Bot`?

        - Used for scripts rather than bots.
        - Lightweight, does not utilize websocket.

        ----------------------------
        Do I have to be logged in to use `Client`?

        - No, you do not have to be logged in to use `Client`.
        - However, you will not be able to use any methods that require authentication.

        `**NON-AUTH EXAMPLE**`
        ```python
        # This method does not require authentication, so it will work without logging in.    

        from pymino import Client

        client = Client()

        print(f"Logged in: {client.is_authenticated}")

        chat_id = client.community.fetch_object_id(link="https://aminoapps.com/p/123456789")

        print(f"Chat ID: {chat_id}")
        ```
        ----------------------------

        How do I login with `Client`?
            - You can login with `Client` by using the `login` method.
            
        `**Login Example**`

        ```python
        from pymino import Client

        client = Client()

        client.login(email="email", password="password")

        print(f"Logged in: {client.is_authenticated}")

        # Output: Logged in: True
        ```
        ----------------------------
        How can I utilize community methods with `Client`?
            - First, you must set the community id.
            - You can set the community id by using the `set_community_id` method
            - Or the `fetch_community_id` method if you do not know the community id.

        `**Community Example**`
        ```python
        from pymino import Client

        client = Client()

        client.login(email="email", password="password")

        print(f"Logged in: {client.is_authenticated}")

        client.fetch_community_id("http://aminoapps.com/c/CommunityName")
        # Or
        client.set_community_id(123456789)

        print(f"Community ID has been set: {client.community_id}")
        ```
        ----------------------------
        `**Community Methods**`
        ```python
        from pymino import Client

        client = Client()

        client.login(email="email", password="password")

        client.fetch_community_id("http://aminoapps.com/c/CommunityName")

        client.community.send_message(

            content = "Hello, world!"
        ) # This will send in the community you set the community id for.

        #Alternatively, you can use the community id as a parameter.

        ----------------------------
        When should I use `Bot` instead of `Client`?

        - If you want to create a bot that responds to commands or events.
        - `Client` does not respond to commands or events.

        ----------------------------

        How do I login to my bot account?

        - You can login to your bot account by using the `run` method.

        ----------------------------

        How do I use the `run` method?
        
        - It's simple! Just use the `run` method like this:

            ```py
            bot = Bot()
            #NOTE: Keep in mind bot.run() should be the last line of your code.
            bot.run(email="email", password="password")
            ```

        ----------------------------
        How do I login to my bot account with a proxy?

        - It's as easy as adding a `proxy` parameter to the `bot` class.

            ```py
            bot = Bot(proxy="http://username:password@ip:port")

            bot.run(email="email", password="password")
            ```
        ----------------------------
        How do I know if my bot is ready?

        - You can check if your bot is ready by using the `is_ready` attribute.
        - `is_ready` is a `bool` that is `True` if the bot is ready and `False` if the bot is not ready.
        - Alternatively, you can use the `on_ready` event.
        - `on_ready` is an event that is called when the bot is ready.

        ----------------------------
        How do I use the `on_ready` event?

        - You can use the `ready` event like this:

            ```py
            bot = Bot()

            @bot.on("on_ready")
            def on_ready():
                print(f"Logged in as {bot.profile.username}(bot.profile.userId)")

            bot.run(email="email", password="password")
            ```
        ----------------------------
        How do I use the is_ready attribute?

        - You can use the `is_ready` attribute like this:

            ```py
            bot = Bot()

            bot.run(email="email", password="password")

            if bot.is_ready:
                print(f"Logged in as {bot.profile.username}(bot.profile.userId)")

            ```
        ----------------------------
        How do I set the community id for my bot?

        - If you know the community id, you can use the `set_community_id` method to set the community id for your bot.
        - Alternatively, if you do not know the community id, you can use the `fetch_community_id` method to get the community id from the community's link.

        ----------------------------
        How do I use the `set_community_id` method?

        - You can use the `set_community_id` method like this:

            ```py
            bot = Bot()

            bot.run(email="email", password="password")
            bot.set_community_id(community_id=123456789)
            ```
        ----------------------------
        How do I use the `fetch_community_id` method?

        - You can use the `fetch_community_id` method like this:

            ```py
            bot = Bot()

            bot.run(email="email", password="password")
            bot.fetch_community_id(community_link="https://aminoapps.com/c/OnePiece")
            ```
        ----------------------------
        Ok, I'm ready to make my first bot! What do I do now?
        - You can start by making a `command`.
        - They are functions that are called when a user sends a message that starts with the `command_prefix`.
        - You can make a command like this:

            ```py
            from pymino import Bot
            from pymino.ext import *

            bot = Bot()

            @bot.command(command_name="ping")
            def ping_command(ctx: Context):
                ctx.send("Pong!")

            bot.run(email="email", password="password")
            ```
        ----------------------------
        What is my command prefix?
        - Your command prefix by default is `!`.
        - You can change your command prefix by using the `command_prefix` parameter in the `Bot` class.
        - You can change your command prefix like this:

            ```py
            bot = Bot(command_prefix=".")
            # Now your command prefix is "." instead of "!".
            ```
        ----------------------------
        Can I use multiple names for my command?
        - Yes! You can use multiple names for your command by using the `aliases` parameter in the `command` decorator.
        - You can use multiple names for your command like this:

            ```py
            from pymino import Bot
            from pymino.ext import *

            bot = Bot()
            #NOTE: This will register the command as "ping", "p", and "pong".
            # Meaning the command will be called if the message starts with "!ping", "!p", or "!pong".
            @bot.command(command_name="ping", aliases=["p", "pong"])
            def ping_command(ctx: Context):
                ctx.send("Pong!")

            bot.run(email="email", password="password")
            ```
        ----------------------------
        How about cooldowns? Can I use them?
        - Yes! You can use cooldowns for your commands by using the `cooldown` parameter in the `command` decorator.
        - You can use cooldowns like this:

            ```py
            from pymino import Bot
            from pymino.ext import *

            bot = Bot()
            #NOTE: This will set the cooldown for the command to 5 seconds.
            # The cooldown is user based, meaning that each user will have their own cooldown.
            @bot.command(command_name="ping", cooldown=5)
            def ping_command(ctx: Context):
                ctx.send("Pong!")

            bot.run(email="email", password="password")
            ```
        ----------------------------
        Is there a help command built in?
        - Yes! There is a built in help command that you can use.
        - It will return a list of all the commands that the bot has and their descriptions.
        
        How do I set the description for my command?
        - You can set the description for your command by using the `command_description` parameter in the `command` decorator.
        - You can set the description for your command like this:

            ```py
            from pymino import Bot
            from pymino.ext import *

            bot = Bot()
            # This way when the user uses the help command, it will return the description for the command.
            @bot.command(command_name="ping", command_description="This command will return pong.")
            def ping_command(ctx: Context):
                ctx.send("Pong!")

            bot.run(email="email", password="password")
            ```
